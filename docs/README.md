# Documentation

This directory provides extra notes for developers. Previously it contained
exported code snippets and environment details that were not intended for
release. Those files have been removed to keep the repository concise.

## Repository overview

The project is organized as follows:

- `app/` – CLI utilities, core features and optional GUI
- `assets/` – bundled resources
- `data/` – small sample data
- `examples/` – usage demonstrations
- `tests/` – unit test suite

Refer to the root `README.md` for usage instructions.
